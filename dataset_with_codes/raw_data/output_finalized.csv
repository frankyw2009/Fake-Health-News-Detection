Pandemic Whistleblower LPN Licensed Practical Nurse Says They Were Told Specifically Not To Give Covid Patients a Medicine They Now Know Would Have Saved Their Lives

The medicine would have made it harder for the blood to clot, saving those who died from blood clots.

 ¡°We were told, do not give COVID patients Ibuprofen. We were not told why. ¡ª If you know anything about Ibuprofen, it is a blood thinner. A lot of people who had complications with COVID from what I've seen personally was from blood clots. What would have prevented a blood clot? A blood thinner.¡±

So I need to say this, and I know that it's gonna pressure some people, but if you were in the medical field when first started in 2020, in March of 2020, I need you to chime in on this because I know I'm not losing my mind. I have even asked coworkers that I worked with at the facility that I worked with at this time, like, do you guys remember this? And they're like, yes. Yes. I do. 

Okay. So when COVID first hit, I'm an LPN, a licensed practical nurse here in Tennessee. Um, I worked at a correctional facility during the hot of COVID from March 1, 2020 to sometime in 2023 is when I worked my last shift. I think April of 2023.

So, anyway, when COVID first hit, we were told, do not give COVID patients Ibuprofen. We were not told why. We were just told, give Tylenol only. We had a whole COVID protocol. We had, you know, Zofran and Imodium and Tylenol on this protocol and so did other facilities, but Ibuprofen was not on this protocol.¡±

¡°I just think I'm starting to put I know it's 4 years later, but I swear to god just now, today, like, I was literally on the boat and just put 2 and 2 together. I was like, wait a damn minute. They told us not to give people with COVID Ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is a blood thinner. A lot of people passed away of blood clots, which could have potentially been avoided by a blood thinner.¡±

¡°I'm not no RN and I'm not an MD. I know I'm just an LPN but I have f**king common sense. Okay, And I have a lot of medical knowledge based off of the providers that I worked with previously who have also talked about stuff like this.

So I'm just saying if you if you remember this and you worked in the medical field as as anything during that time and you witnessed what I'm talking about, please chime in because I know I'm not I'm not going crazy.

""I am a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurse. For almost 14 years I worked in some of the best children‚Äôs hospitals in the country.

When you work in healthcare, you mostly just assume that everything is research-based, done with purpose, and done for the ultimate good of the patient. ‚ÄúFirst, do no harm‚Ä? right? I think having my own child and realizing the gravity of my decisions regarding his care have made me dig very VERY deep into the research behind what has come to be second nature to the majority of us: vaccines.""

""I am not a crazy, emotionally-driven person. I think anyone reading this knows me well enough to appreciate that about me. My husband will tell you that I research things to death ‚Ä?it‚Äôs true. I don‚Äôt watch TV and I couldn‚Äôt care less about what Hollywood celebrities have to say about any topic. I never was even interested in the autism aspect/argument, and that is not at all what led me to start looking into vaccine research. It was actually one of my best friends who is a critical care pediatric nurse practitioner ‚Ä?she was always in favor of vaccines, worked in cardiac ICU and oncology units in reputable children‚Äôs hospitals and thought it was crazy not to vaccinate your kids. Flash forward to today and none of her children are vaccinated. She is one of the smartest, most well-read and well-researched people I know. She has written medical journal articles and has contributed chapters to medical textbooks. She does NOT make decisions without a great deal of research, thought and prayer. So when she did a 180 on vaccines, I listened. And I began to research on my own.""

I went from spending 14 years of my nursing career giving vaccines to my patients and thinking parents who didn‚Äôt vaccinate were irresponsible and crazy, to now recognizing the great harm that is being done to our children by the vaccine industry. Autoimmune disease, asthma, eczema, food allergies (especially peanut), seizure disorders, learning disabilities, chronic ear infections, allergies ‚Ä?all these health issues are running rampant in our kids.

I witnessed countless occasions of vaccine injury in the NICU, and the truly disturbing part is that it is considered ‚Äúnormal‚Ä? We would vaccinate babies and then inevitably that night or the next day the baby would have increased apnea spells (they would stop breathing), they would require increased ventilator support, they‚Äôd have more feeding difficulties or higher amounts of gastric residual/vomiting. The doctors were never surprised. This was just an expected response to vaccination. This was the standard in every NICU I worked in (that would be 6 different NICUs all over the country).

I also never ONCE, not in 14 years, observed a doctor giving true informed consent to parents regarding vaccinating their baby.

 It was our job as the nurse to get the parents to just sign the consent form after handing them a printed off sheet from the CDC which was strongly biased toward vaccination. If you were told the truth that your baby could stop breathing after getting vaccines, would you perhaps question it? Or at least ask to postpone until they are older? If you as a parent aren‚Äôt 100% certain that the medical intervention you are giving your child is safe and healthy for them, then you have the right (and the responsibility) to say no. Ask to wait. Ask to delay until you research further. You can always vaccinate later. You can never UN-vaccinate. Every state allows for vaccine exemptions for your child to attend public school. Most allow for religious or conscience exemptions (47 states) in addition to medical exemptions.

I am not demanding that you stop vaccinating your kids. I am simply urging you to question. Do your own research. Find sources that aren‚Äôt bought and paid for by the pharmaceutical industry. Make sure there aren‚Äôt conflicts of interest. """,1

"Ray Peat on Baking Soda, Carbon Dioxide, and Cancer

This organism that’s sometimes called a tumor is trying to heal, it’s lacking in something. Do we know what it’s lacking in? 

For one thing, carbon dioxide. The person who asked about a fungus probably heard about Simoncini in Italy. Baking soda, interestingly, often provides what the tumor lacks to be able to heal, which is carbon dioxide—sodium plus carbon dioxide.

In the 18th century, people were already experimenting. The discovery of carbonated water was closely related to the observation that carbon dioxide helps with cancer. People saw a great improvement in breast cancer just by exposing it to carbon dioxide. There’s a book that reviews the history of treating cancer with carbon dioxide, including carbon dioxide enemas, breathing it, or sitting in a bag full of it to absorb through the skin.

When you’re under stress, the characteristic feature of cancer identified by Otto Warburg a hundred years ago is that it can’t stop producing lactic acid. This is normal in an injury, but injured tissue producing lactic acid stimulates growth, which helps healing. At some point, though, the lactic acid must stop to allow the tissue to mature instead of continuing to grow. Carbon dioxide is a feature, produced by respiring mitochondria, that should turn off lactic acid production. If something limits your ability to produce and retain carbon dioxide, you can’t turn off lactic acid.

Simoncini’s baking soda sometimes provides enough sodium and bicarbonate (or carbon dioxide) to suppress lactic acid and allow healing.

Why is carbon dioxide production sometimes low? 

Factors like low thyroid, low calcium, low vitamin D, and low sodium can all limit carbon dioxide production.

Would it be reasonable to occasionally take a teaspoon of baking soda? 

Athletes find their endurance greatly increased with typical doses of a tablespoon of baking soda at the start of an endurance race.

Well, here I am 12 years post diagnosis, and cancer free. I followed the full Gerson therapy, vitamin B 17 oral therapy, high dose  vitamin C therapy and mistletoe/Isidor injections into my abdomen.

"NEW ARTICLE: IVERMECTIN and MEBENDAZOLE Testimonial - Young European woman with Large B-Cell Lymphoma cleared of cancer in 2 months!

A young woman with Large B-Cell Lymphoma started a regimen of Ivermectin and Mebendazole in late May 2024.

Ivermectin 1mg/kg/day
Mebendazole 200mg/day
followed by R-CHOP x 2 cycles

Comparison between PET scans done in September and again in late November 2024

RESULT: Complete resolution of Large B-Cell Lymphoma on PET scans 2 months apart!

European Oncologist’s advice was to NOT take Ivermectin or Mebendazole during chemo (they're no better than the mRNA poisoned, cognitively impaired Oncologists here).

My advice was: “Please continue Ivermectin and Mebendazole during chemo”.

Guess which advice was correct? 😉

For those of you who are not used to looking at PET scans, this is a dramatic result. Complete resolution of disease. 

I was so happy for this couple! 

And they wished me well with the current attacks and attempts by Alberta Health Services lawyers and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith @ABDanielleSmith Office to have me imprisoned for 83 days for protecting my family from corrupt bureaucrats.

Because the eyes of the world are watching and people are disgusted with Alberta government's abuses of doctors who upheld their Hippocratic Oath (while the College of Physicians and Surgeons @CPSA_CA gives child sex traffickers medical licenses so they can have better access to Alberta's children, thousands of good doctors, nurses and healthcare workers continue to be harassed, persecuted and abused without any help from the government).

"After 3 decades of listening to his doctors, my father ended up with diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

After 3 years of listening to his son, my father ended up 40lbs lighter and cancer-free.

Here are 39 health secrets his doctors forgot to tell him:

1. Stop doing diets that have a name.

2. Carbs don't make you fat - too many calories do.

3. Your physical health and mental health are not two separate things - they are reflections of one another. 

4. The only *permanent* hack to drink less alcohol is to build a life so good you no longer feel the need to escape it.

5. Working out 3-5 days/wk is more sustainable long term than 6-7 days/wk. 

6. The only equipment you *need* is your body. 

7. Drinking diet Coke is significantly healthier than drinking regular Coke. 

8. Resistance training is far superior to cardio for fat loss.

9. The only “diet” that works is a high-protein one. 

10. Eating protein before carbs is the easiest way to crave less carbs.

11. Skipping workouts to spend more time with your family shortens your time on earth with your family. 

12. Self-deprecating humor is a sign that you are not mentally healthy. 

13. Exercise is a documented antidepressant - use it as such. 

14. Most hunger scares can be cured by drinking water. 

15. Sodium is not killing you it is keeping you alive. 

16. Your habits make you fat not the “fat gene”. 

17.  Constantly wearing running shoes weakens your feet, core, and lower back.

18. Train your back and your core 2x as much as everything else. 

19. Wear blue light glasses or put your phone in “night mode” to improve your sleep quality. 

20. Take cold showers or ice baths periodically to increase your stress tolerance. 

21. Cardio is less about fat loss and more about strengthening your heart and mind. 

22. Eating your protein first will prevent you from overeating elsewhere. 

23. Nuts are not a “healthy” snack. They are high fat, high calorie, and easy to overeat.

24. Lifting weights is the most effective workout method to lower your body fat percentage and improve your health. 

25. Just because something is “vegan” does not mean it’s healthy. 

26. Intermittent fasting is not a magic pill. It works because you eat less food.

27. Working out is not just for looks. Your body is the temple of God and you should honor it as such.

28. Stop waiting till your next doctor's visit to weigh yourself. You can’t manage a problem you avoid confronting. Weigh yourself daily instead.

29. Having no routine on the weekends is saying your goals don’t matter 29% of the time. 

30. Turn the room temperature down to 68 degrees or lower at night. We fall asleep faster in colder environments. 

31. Eat slower. It gives your body time to secret Leptin, the “I’m full” hormone.

32. Find an active hobby you enjoy and participate in it regularly. 

33. Stop picking up your phone as soon as you wake up. Mindless morning scrolling starts the day off with unnecessary stress. Wait 30 minutes to check your phone instead.

34. Stop sleeping on your side, it deteriorates your shoulder health over time. Sleep on your back instead.

35. Don’t drink coffee as soon as you wake up - but don’t drink coffee in the afternoon either. Both extremes mess up your hormones.

36. Men operate on a 24-hour hormone cycle. Our drive is highest in the morning. Take advantage of this and work out before your family wakes up.

37. Mindless snacking is less about hunger and more about your lack of emotional control. 

38. I’ve never seen anyone keep the weight off long-term without accountability outside of themselves. Share your goals with other men. 

39. Motivation is fleeting - you must establish proper default actions to actually be consistent.",0

"Drinking 3 cups of coffee or 200–300 mg of caffeine per day lowers your risk of developing diabetes, heart disease, or stroke by up to 48%!

Compared to people who don’t consume coffee or caffeine, people who are moderate consumers are less likely to have new-onset cardiometabolic disease, according to a new study. They’re also less likely to progress to multimorbidity—the presence of two or more conditions—during a follow-up period of nearly 12 years.

Although a moderate intake was associated with the lowest risk, even high intakes of coffee and caffeine were protective!

For example, consuming 4–5 cups of coffee per day was associated with a 35–40% lower disease risk compared to people who never consume coffee. For caffeine, consuming as much as 400 mg or more per day was associated with a 41% lower risk.

This might have something to do with lipoproteins—metabolites expressing HDL subclasses were positively associated with moderate coffee intake while those expressing VLDL subclasses showed a negative association.

There is also good news for tea drinkers. People consuming 3–4 or more cups of tea per day were up to 40% less likely to develop cardiometabolic disease than non-tea drinkers.

The takeaway?

I don’t think this means you should drink more coffee, caffeine, or tea in hopes of reducing your disease risk. But if you’re already drinking a moderate amount of caffeinated beverages, I think it’s safe to say that you’re not harming your health, and you might even be protecting yourself against certain diseases.

"China has developed a surgical cure for alzheimers

China successfully invented a surgery for curing Alzheimer’s disease. Known as LVA surgery, it is performned on neck lymphatics. So far, there have been 42 clinical trials, all have been successes.⬇️
-
LVA Surgery, otherewise known as deep cervical lymphatic-venous anastomosis surgery was performed on a 76-year-old man with moderate Alzheimer's disease, his symptoms were significantly improved. The follow-up results two months after the operation showed that the old man not only had a significant recovery in memory, but also could communicate normally with others.
-
The theoretical basis of deep cervical lymphatic-venous anastomosis is the abnormal accumulation of Aβ-amyloid protein and abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein in the brain, which are two important causes of Alzheimer's disease
-
The operation uses super microsurgery technology to shunt the lymphatic circulation in the meninges, accelerate the return of intracerebral lymph through the jugular foramen at the skull base, and take away more metabolic products in the brain, thereby achieving the goal of possibly reversing brain degenerative lesions and slowing the progression of the disease.
-
It can be simply understood as a mechanical excretion process. The abnormal accumulation of amyloid protein in the elderly's brain is like a clogged sewer, and the ""waste"" cannot be transported out in time. The deep cervical lymphatic-venous anastomosis can greatly speed up the removal of ""waste"" and improve the removal efficiency.
-
On the morning of November 11, Professor Tang Juyu, director of the Microsurgery Reconstruction Clinical Research Center of Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, had just completed the 42nd deep cervical lymphatic-venous anastomosis in the hospital. Because it was a minimally invasive surgery, the patient could get out of bed and move around the next day. 
-
Among these 42 patients, in addition to restoring their memories, Tang Juyu also saw that patients who were originally indifferent and taciturn could communicate with him in a cheerful and talkative manner during the follow-up visit after the operation.
-
Although many patients have significant symptom improvement after surgery, experts believe that this surgery can only provide a new idea for the current treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and its specific effectiveness still needs more research to confirm.

"Eating more eggs could reduce your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by nearly 50%.

And for women, eggs may mitigate changes in cognitive function due to old age.

That's what a pair of new studies suggests.

In one study, a higher egg intake was associated with less of a decline in verbal fluency among women during a 4-year period, with those consuming 5 or more eggs per week experiencing the greatest benefit. However, no association between egg intake and cognitive function changes was observed in men.

In the other study, eating 2 or more eggs per week was associated with a 47% reduction in Alzheimer's disease risk over a nearly 7-year follow-up period.

But that's not all—an analysis of brain samples from participants who died during the study revealed that consuming 1 or more eggs per week reduced the odds of having a pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease by up to 49%—indicated by the presence of fewer plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.

These effects are likely due to choline—an essential nutrient that serves as a precursor for methylation, affecting epigenetics globally, and plays a role in the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Choline is also converted into phosphatidylcholine, a crucial component of cell membranes that regulates intracellular transportation. Choline literally makes up the stuff of our brain and cells.

40% of the beneficial effects of eggs on Alzheimer's disease risk reduction were directly mediated by choline intake, highlighting the critical importance of this nutrient for brain health and reducing neurodegenerative disease burden.

Not only are eggs rich in choline, but they're packed with omega-3 fatty acids and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, which have well-known benefits for the brain.

I'm covering both of these studies and more on eggs and brain health in tomorrow's newsletter.

"Dr. Pierre Kory: Big Pharma is ‘TERRIFIED’ of Vitamin D

Looking at data from 16 different studies and 1.26 million individuals, the meta-analysis revealed:

• Vitamin D showed about a 60% effectiveness against the incidence of COVID-19 in randomized control trials.

• Vitamin D showed about 40-50% effectiveness in reducing the incidence of COVID-19 in observational studies.

• For preventing severe COVID-19 cases requiring ICU care, vitamin D supplementation was about 70% effective.

The other remarkable thing about Vitamin D is that it decreases your risk of death from the biggest k*ller in the world: heart disease.

And here's the shocking truth about sunscreen, according to Dr. Joseph Mercola: “You INCREASE the risk of skin cancer!”

How?

Sunscreen prevents sunburn by blocking UVB rays, which are crucial for vitamin D production. But it doesn't block UVA rays, which cause most skin cancers.

So, not only are you letting the harmful rays through but you're doing so while blocking vitamin D production. Double whammy!

That has to make sunscreen one of the biggest SCAMS ever sold.",1

"NEW ARTICLE: Vitamin D deficiency was the KEY factor in severe COVID-19 & death. Vitamin D was all that was needed (Public Health - they all knew it). 

At least 4 early Vitamin D studies were sabotaged/removed 

(did Vitamin D get the ""Ivermectin treatment"" in 2020?)

New Zealand Chief Science Advisor put out a report on June 2, 2020 concluding that Vitamin D deficiency played a KEY role in severe COVID-19 & death.

It documented latest research, papers by Philippine and Indonesian researchers showing that severe COVID-19 & death were linked with Vitamin D deficiency.

A month later both papers were removed and the Indonesian researchers disappeared off the face of the earth, while a paper (also from Indonesia) came out claiming Vitamin D is ""misinformation"" and the Indonesian researchers NEVER EXISTED!

Were these early Vitamin D & COVID-19 researchers killed off?

Later research from around the world proved them right.

~90% of COVID-19 deaths occurred in patients with Vitamin D levels < 30 ng/ml

~95% of COVID-19 deaths occurred in patients with Vitamin D levels < 40 ng/ml

Higher Vitamin D levels meant mild COVID-19 infection with minimal or no hospitalization or death!

All that was needed was Vitamin D testing and supplementation and it wasn't done. Not by a single Public Health Official, Health Minister or politician.

If the New Zealand government knew by June 2020 that all you needed was to supplement people with Vitamin D to save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic, then all governments knew.

If all governments knew about Vitamin D and chose not to supplement their population with Vitamin D or to promote Vitamin D, then their intent was always to allow people to die from COVID-19 and drive up the death toll.

That doesn't include the Midazolam/Morphine euthanasia protocols enacted in Long Term Care homes to kill off the elderly in 2020 in UK and Canada and blame the deaths on COVID-19.

Was Vitamin D the victim of a smear campaign and sabotage during May-Sep 2020, right around the time that Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin were sabotaged as well by fraudulent papers (like the Mehra / Surgisphere May 2020 paper in Lancet #Lancetgate that killed hydroxychloroquine)?

""Real-Time Self-Assembly of Stereomicroscopically Visible Artificial Constructions in Incubated Specimens of mRNA Products Mainly from Pfizer and Moderna: A Comprehensive Longitudinal Study  https://t.co/waJHeMmDkH

Our observations suggest the presence of some kind of nanotechnology in the COVID-19 injectables.  International Journal of Vaccine Theory, Practice, and Research  https://t.co/ypi0lH4O78

Full version of the journal Vol. 3 No. 2 (2024): Injuries, Causes, and Treatments, Part 2 https://t.co/3dDqfnioCl

Creative Commons link https://t.co/AscFAWg82z

Observable real-time injuries at the cellular level in recipients of the “safe and effective” COVID-19 injectables are documented here for the first time,  with the presentation of a comprehensive description and analysis of observed phenomena.

The global administration of these often-mandated products from late 2020 triggered a plethora of independent research studies of the modified RNA injectable gene therapies,   most notably those manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna.

Analyses reported here consist of precise laboratory “bench science” aiming to understand why serious debilitating, prolonged injuries (and many deaths) occurred increasingly without any measurable protective effect

The contents of COVID-19 injectables were examined under a stereomicroscope at up to 400X magnification.

Carefully preserved specimens were cultured in a range of distinct media to observe immediate and long-term cause-and-effect relationships between the injectables and living cells under carefully controlled conditions.

From such research, reasonable inferences can be drawn about observed injuries worldwide that have occurred since the injectables were pressed upon billions of individuals.

In addition to cellular toxicity, our findings reveal numerous — on the order of 3~4 x 106 per milliliter of the injectable   — visible artificial self-assembling entities ranging from about 1 to 100 µm, or greater, of many different shapes.

There were animated worm-like entities,   discs, chains, spirals, tubes,   right-angle structures containing other artificial entities within them  All these are exceedingly beyond any expected and acceptable levels of contamination of the COVID-19 injectables,   and incubation studies revealed the progressive self-assembly of many artifactual structures.

As time progressed during incubation, simple one- and two-dimensional structures over two or three weeks became more complex in shape and size developing into stereoscopically visible entities in three-dimensions.

They resembled carbon nanotube filaments, ribbons, and tapes,  some appearing as transparent, thin, flat membranes,   and others as three-dimensional spirals, and beaded chains.

Some of these seemed to appear and then disappear over time.   Our observations suggest the presence of some kind of nanotechnology in the COVID-19 injectables.

"4 Ways Excess Sugar Poisons Your Heart...
Dr Jeremy London, MD

1: Insulin Resistance...which leads to Metabolic Syndrome. A constellation of abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high triglycerides & low HDL which are all cardiovascular risk factors.

2: Fatty Liver...any excess glucose is turned into fat cells, which the liver stores. Over time, fat cells replace liver cells, leading to fatty liver disease. This results in toxic levels of heart damaging triglycerides & at the same time protective HDL levels plummet.

3: Inflammation & Oxidative Stress...from excess sugar is the driver of chronic disease, including heart disease. Excess sugar increases free radical formation in the bloodstream & directly injures blood vessels.

4: High Uric Acid...is produced from excess sugar which then shuts off crucial & vital Nitric Oxide production for heart health. Without Nitric Oxide's protective effect on blood vessels, blood pressure can rise to dangerous levels.

All of these can be reversed by adopting a Low Carbohydrate whole foods way of eating. A ketogenic carb restricted diet focusing on nutrient dense animal foods that eliminates:

Ultra Processed Foods
Processed Sugar
Seed Oils
High Carb Starches

Contrary to what the current USDA ""Food Guidelines"" are...Cheerios, Margarine & Soy Milk are not ""heart healthy.""

The most healing & proper human diet on the planet is built upon the foundations of Ruminant Meat, Eggs, Pastured Poultry, Wild Caught Fish, Butter, Ghee & Tallow. These promote vibrant health to shine & encourage disease prevention with increased longevity.

"Sugar is the sweet destroyer of cellular health and heart health. In fact, sugar promotes atherosclerosis, obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, high blood cholesterol and hypertension. There is a staggering intake of sugar in the diet - unknowingly.

The average American ingests a whopping 156 pounds of added sugar every year. Many have no idea they are ingesting this much as it is added to almost every food available.

Many folks are purchasing what they assume to be ‘healthy’ foods when in fact, they are preventing optimal health and heart health. They buy fruited yogurts which can have more sugar than a candy bar; they bring home whole wheat bread – eating 2 slices of whole wheat bread raises  your blood sugar more than eating 2 tablespoons of table sugar does and  fruit juice enters the picture too – which is simply liquid sugar.

"‼️😷‼️ BREAKING MEDICAL NEWS: The California Medical Board just emailed every doctor about a “Substantial Increase in Tuberculosis (TB)”. Why is this a BIG deal? In their own words:

“•In 2023, the number of reported tuberculosis (TB) cases increased by 271 (15%) from 1,842 in 2022 to 2,113 in 2023.  
•Since 2020, TB cases in California have been increasing each year for a total increase of 24%.  
•… the percentage of people with TB who die has been increasing. In 2010, 8.4% of people with TB died and in 2020, 13% of people with TB died.”

So we have 24% increase in TB cases and now it has a 13% death rate! And unlike COVID, this is not an exaggeration! 

What is TB? “TB is an illness caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB usually affects the lungs and spreads through the air when a person sick with TB coughs. Not everyone infected with the bacteria becomes sick. People that have been infected but are not sick have LTBI. People with LTBI can become sick with TB disease in the future if they do not take treatment for LTBI.”

But WHY the surge?? Well there’s more. In their own words: “TB in California particularly affects people who were born outside the United States with more than 80% of cases occurring in this group. The rate of TB among people born outside the United States is many times higher than among those born in the United States.”

How are we suddenly seeing a surge of people born outside the United States, who are carrying TB, actively infected by TB, and dying from it, while also potentially spreading it throughout the community? The answer is very likely illegal immigration. Here is why:

While TB has historically not been a problem in the United States after this horrible infection was largely eradicated many years ago, it remains a major problem in many parts of the world, including Mexico and central and South America. This is why getting an immigrant visa or green card requires a thorough medical examination INCLUDING TB blood test, chest x-ray if needed to rule out TB, numerous vaccinations including COVID, and testing for several sexually transmitted diseases, not to mention screening for alcohol and drug abuse. When we talk about legal immigration, these are some of the key components that we largely ignore. But we have these rules in order to prevent people from abroad from bringing in deadly infections. 

This recent surge in tuberculosis cases, not to mention the recent outbreak of measles infections in illegal immigrant shelters in the Midwest, is proof that we are not doing what is absolutely essential to maintain public health. As the alert mentioned, tuberculosis has a 13% death rate. And the only way to avoid it is to wear an N 95 mask incidentally! This is the one disease for this mask was actually created!

Public health must become a key component of this conversation. Our immigration crisis is not only about public safety and economics, but has very clear and immediate health ramifications as well. No one wants tuberculosis to exist in our country in the way that it exists outside the United States. And there’s no vaccine for it as well!

Let’s make this a priority. Asap.",1

"Hi, if you or anyone you know has hepatitis B virus infection, please read this.

I am not sure you've heard this, but something very interesting and hopeful is happening in treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

After kicking the Hepatitis C Viruses (HCV) rear end and grabbing a Nobel Prize in the process, the medical research community has been focusing on deleting this real tough virus - the HBV that affects millions worldwide and cause liver failure, cirrhosis, and liver cancer as well as other types of cancers.

HBV is far more difficult to cure than HCV because this little (but very smart) bugger integrates into the human liver cell DNA while HCV virus just reproduces and party outside on the home lawn, i.e., outside the nucleus (within cytoplasm part of the cell) and its easy to just call the cops (direct acting antivirals) and get them off the grass. But HBV is deep inside the house, much inside the second level basement and also in the attic and hidden. So cops wont always find them and they stay right at home, damaging it from inside.

And now, looks like the first rays of the light at the end of a very long and dark tunnel are here.

Bepirovirsen, a new drug developed by the biotechnology company Ionis Pharmaceuticals in association with GSK (GlaxoSmithKline) Inc is now granted US FDA Fast-Track Status because initial studies show that the drug could be a major player in providing a functional cure for people chronically infected with hepatitis B virus infection

For the importance of ""functional cure"" we must know few clear aspects in hepatitis B related treatments. Not all patients require treatment for HBV infection. 

To oversimplify: Some who are in specific categories - such as those with signficant liver fibrosis, stable and unstable cirrhosis, liver failure due to HBV infection (acute infection or reactivation), those with liver cancer or high risk of liver cancer, pregnant women with high viral load (virus DNA in blood) and those on other treatments such as chemotherapy or immunosuppression (to prevent virus reactivation) require HBV treatment.

There are 5 types of treatment goals
Viral suppression - that is reducing the virus DNA in blood (very easily done with current therapies like Tenofovir alfenamide)

Partial cure - sustained virus replication control (happens only in <20% when they are off medicine, so need to continue long term medicine, like Tenofovir)

Functional cure - virus DNA is not detectable and HBsAg (the surface antigen marker of infection) also becomes non-reactive and patients attain antibodies to HBV (that is anti-HBs becomes positive) - not fully achievable with current medications like Tenofovir or Entecavir (happens, but only in <10% in very very long term - like sometimes, a lifetime)

Complete cure - elimination of integrated viral particles in the liver cell nucleus (called cccDNA) but there will be some persistence of integrated DNA (not acheivable, very tough with current medications)

Sterilizing cure - elimination of all viral particles, including all integrated viral particles (not achievable with any drug at present or in the near future)

At present we are stuck at partial cure since decades. But now, with the advent of Bepirovirsen, we are slowly moving into the realm of a ""functional cure.""

Bepirovirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) - one that messes up the virus messenger RNA pathways, and is the only single agent in phase 3 development that has shown the potential to achieve clinically meaningful functional cure response when combined with current oral medicines such as Tenofovir. 

Bepirovirsen inhibits the replication of viral DNA in the body, suppresses the level of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the blood, and stimulates the immune system to increase the chances of a durable and sustained response of viral clearance from our bodies. This is just brilliant and beautiful.

Bepirovirsen is also being investigated as a potential backbone therapy in future sequential regimens to pursue functional cure in a broader population of patients with chronic HBV infection.

This is big and could be a huge relief for many patients sufferring from chronic HBV infection and on long term current medications.

I hope we get to see more such developments for HBV infection and inch closer to that complete cure someday. Medical science will take us there. Dont worry, be happy.

PS: Also remember the name: Dr. Man-Fung Yeun (this man has been the biggest pain in the a** for HBV and a brilliant asset for the liver patient community) and this new drug is also thanks to his major works on treatment of HBV infection.
